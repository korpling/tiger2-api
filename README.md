# tiger2-api

&lt;tiger2/> is a standard conformant XML format modelled to express syntactic structures for a wide variety of theoretical formalisms and corpus architectures. It is closely related to and develops the ideas found in TigerXML: the declared goal of the project is to expand TigerXML only as much as required for the representation of current advanced syntactic resources, without any changes that are not strictly necessary and might increase the learning curve or require substantial alterations to existing tools. The format is similarly conceived as theory neutral, as it is suited to both shallow and deep parsing in any number of theories and supports both pure constituency and dependency trees, as well as combinations of the two.
